# CryptoMaster
.Net core 2 + Vue.js app to compare cryptocurrency listings and store user purchases. Another show-off project.

### The motivation
I wanted to learn cool technologies but got left out of ideas for the project. 
Since I consider myself an earlyadopter of cryptocurrencies I thought what the hell. Let's take good stuff and implement them into something useful. 
So there it is, the comparison site and investment tracker all-in-one. Hope the big guys won't sue me. 

Enjoy =)

The kudos for the ideas go to guys who wrote following articles:
